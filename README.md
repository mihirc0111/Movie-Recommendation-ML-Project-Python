# Movie-Recommendation-ML-Project-Python
 To find similarities between various movies and to find a close match for the movie entered by the user using movie genre and ratings.
 
I made a Movie Recommendation system in which i used libraries like Numpy, pandas, difflib, os, TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity from sklearn, to find similarities between various movies and to find a close match for the movie entered by the user using movie genre and ratings.

I would like to learn futher advance techniques which will help my model to predict on basis of reviews.
